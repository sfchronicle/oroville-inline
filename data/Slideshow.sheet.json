As storms raged in early February, dam operators released heavy flows down the Feather River, but a crisis began when a crater opened on the main spillway. Days later, water poured over an emergency spillway – essentially a hillside – that had never been used. The erosion of the hillside prompted the evacuation of nearly 200,000 people downstream."
